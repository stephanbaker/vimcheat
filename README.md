# Vim Cheat

Simple command line utility to assist with learning commands available in vim.

When creating this utility, I referenced the web-based cheat sheet at https://vim.rtorr.com/.

# Usage

For now, I simply use grep to quickly search for the cheat sheet for the information I need.

Examples:

```
vimcheat | grep :w
vimcheat | grep "save file as"
vimcheat | grep save
```
